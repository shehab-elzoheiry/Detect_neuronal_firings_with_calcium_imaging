# detect_neuronal_firings_with_calcium_imaging

This script fits high resolution electrophysiological recordings with low resolution recordings of calcium fluorescent signal. This is required to correspond firing activity of certain neurons with their calcium imaging. The output is count, average firings and interspike interval for each neuron during calcium imaging recordings.
